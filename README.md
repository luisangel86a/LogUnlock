# LogUnlock
Log the time when your android device getting unlocked.
## Usage
Install the apk (you can download it from the releases).
Run the app and keep it open in the background.
## Notes
The app only log when it's in the memory. I could write a background service for this, but I didn't want it to always run.
## TODO
- Photo with the front camera (if have) when unlocked.
- Better data storing.
- Better log display in the main activity.
- Maybe a background service?
- Local authentication in the app (to protect view and clear logs).
